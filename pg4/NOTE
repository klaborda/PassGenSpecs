.chars() was being problematic for me, so I renamed to .setChars()

Also, I couldn't use attr_accessor and get it to return a string via the index of the availChars array.  It would return 98 instead of 'b'.  
98 is the ASCII code for the letter 'b', so it must have been cast somewhere.  I modified the test to cast it back to a character.
